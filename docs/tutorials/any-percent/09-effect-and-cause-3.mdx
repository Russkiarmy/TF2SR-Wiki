# ðŸ›‘ Effect & Cause 3

:::tip good to know

This level will begin on the **same timeline** that the previous level ended on - this is important as the button at the start is only interactable in the past. 

Ideally, you should do an extra timeswap at the very end of effect and cause 2 so you can reach the button at the start of this level with no issues.

[left route or right route? -mats]

:::

:::info Note to editors

- how do the route on the left and one the right after ship compare in difficulty and time saved?
- are both viable or is one just better? 
- i barely know anything about that so i'd be nice to know if we need an extra segment for different strats there or if we can just put one/include that in the Ship part
